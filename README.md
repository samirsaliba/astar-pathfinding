# astar-pathfinding
Simple A* pathfinding algorithm

Set the edges and straight line distances between cities (heuristic) via the cidades.csv file

First column: 'e' for edge or 'h' for heuristic,

Second column: first city

Third column: second city

Fourth column: value

To initialize the algorithm, set one row like:  a*, from city, to city
